            Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is at the
            center of the case, including his actions leading to the Jan. 6
            attack on the United States Capitol. After he was indicted by a
            federal grand jury, the former president’s attorneys argued that he
            could not be charged due to having “absolute immunity” from criminal
            prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Presidents are immune from civil damages related to the “outer
            perimeter” of their duties, as the high court ruled in 1982, because
            civil suits could distract the president from his responsibilities.
            The court has not yet taken a stand on criminal prosecutions related
            to duties in office.
        </p>
        <p>
            “This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future
            of the presidency, for the future of the country,” Justice Brett
            Kavanaugh said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Justices seemed focused on how their decision could impact future
            presidencies, either holding presidents to account or setting up a
            system that would be open to revenge politics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some justices, including Ketanji Brown Jackson, were concerned that
            taking away the possibility of criminal prosecution could encourage
            presidents to engage in more illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the
            Oval Office into the seat of criminal activity in this country,”
            Jackson said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple justices – both liberal and conservative – appeared
            unwilling to hold the president to a standard equivalent to the
            rights of a monarch.
        </p>
        <p>
            D. John Sauer, the attorney representing Trump, argued that
            presidential decisions could be clouded by a fear of criminal<br />
            prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
            “That looming threat will distort the president’s decision-making
            precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed,” Sauer said.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Jackson countered that many people have jobs where they are
            expected to make life-and-death consequential decisions in the
            workplace with the possibility of criminal prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other justices were concerned that setting up a system of criminal
            prosecution could lead to sitting presidents afraid to make
            difficult decisions, presidents pardoning themselves and
            politically-driven criminal cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The latter point brought the court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch
            and Amy Coney Barrett, to a discussion around how motive could be a
            deciding factor for future criminal cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target
            political opponents based on accusations about their motives,”
            Gorsuch said. “We’re writing a rule for the ages.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant portion of the justices&#8217; questions centered
            around how a president’s actions can be classified as either
            official, subject to immunity, or private, which would not be
            granted any legal shield.
        </p>
        <p>
            Justice Elena Kagan asked Trump’s legal representation, Sauer,
            whether a president ordering the military to stage a coup would be
            considered an official act.
        </p>
        <p>
            “That might well be an official act and he would have to be, as
            I&#8217;ll say in response to all these kinds of hypotheticals, has
            to be impeached (by the Congress) and convicted before he can be
            criminally prosecuted,” Sauer said.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the 2020 election, Trump, Gorsuch suggested, was at moments
            acting as an elected official and at others, a candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both conservative and liberal justices conceded that a democratic
            system of government relies on leaders who uphold its legitimacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            “A stable, democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an
            election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office
            peacefully if that candidate is the incumbent,” Justice Samuel Alito
            said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted the layers of protections
            the judicial system provides for defendants. She asked Michael
            Dreeben, attorney for Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting
            Trump in two federal trials, about who bears responsibility for
            failures in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            “In the end, if it fails completely, it’s because we destroyed
            democracy on our own, isn’t it?” Sotomayor asked. Dreeben agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think one of the ways in which abuses are limited is
            accountability under the criminal law for criminal violations,”
            Dreeben replied. “But the ultimate check is the goodwill and faith
            in democracy.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Trump’s federal trial on 2020 election subversion charges has been
            delayed until the court rules on his claim of presidential immunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221;
            Thomas was involved in trying to stop the certification of the 2020
            election, did not recuse himself from hearing the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to facing felony counts of falsifying business records
            to influence the election in his current Manhattan trial, Trump
            faces criminal charges in Georgia, where he is accused of
            interfering with the state’s 2020 presidential election results, and
            in Florida, where he is accused of keeping classified documents in
            his Mar-a-Lago home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earlier this month, the high court heard oral arguments in Fischer
            v. United States, which questioned the applicability of a federal
            obstruction charge to more than 350 Jan. 6 defendants. Trump was
            also charged with obstruction in his Jan. 6 case.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Supreme Court could decide on the cases anytime, but most likely
            in June or early July.
