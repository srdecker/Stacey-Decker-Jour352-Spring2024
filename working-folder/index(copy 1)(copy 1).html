            Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is at the
            center of the case, including his actions leading to the Jan. 6
            attack on the United States Capitol. After he was indicted by a
            federal grand jury, the former president’s attorneys argued that he
            could not be charged due to having “absolute immunity” from criminal
            prosecution.

            Presidents are immune from civil damages related to the “outer
            perimeter” of their duties, as the high court ruled in 1982, because
            civil suits could distract the president from his responsibilities.
            The court has not yet taken a stand on criminal prosecutions related
            to duties in office.

            “This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future
            of the presidency, for the future of the country,” Justice Brett
            Kavanaugh said.

            Justices seemed focused on how their decision could impact future
            presidencies, either holding presidents to account or setting up a
            system that would be open to revenge politics.

            Some justices, including Ketanji Brown Jackson, were concerned that
            taking away the possibility of criminal prosecution could encourage
            presidents to engage in more illegal activity.
