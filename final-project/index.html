                        I’d been waiting for months when I finally got the call
                        from Alaska last March: Wild ice was on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A roughly two-week high-pressure window of cold and
                        clear weather had frozen Portage Lake, the terminus of
                        Portage Glacier, some 50 miles southeast of Anchorage,
                        and it was solid enough to skate on its wild — or
                        natural — ice.
                    </p>

                        class="inlineimage"
                        alt="A glacier" />

                    <p>
                        “Skating A-grade ice under a glacier really is a ‘take
                        off work now and just go to it’ type of treat, even for
                        us Alaskans,” said Paxson Woelber, who owns the
                        Anchorage-based skate manufacturer Ermine Skate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A few months earlier, I had purchased a pair of Ermine
                        Nordic skates, long blades similar to speed skates that
                        affix to the bindings of cross-country ski boots. The
                        compatibility allows skiers to get to remote ice, then
                        switch into blades to skate without changing boots and,
                        as Mr. Woelber put it, “get you off the rink.”

                        While figure and hockey skates are designed for
                        maneuverability, including directional changes and tight
                        turns, Nordic skates are designed for distance. The
                        longer, faster blades require less effort to propel, and
                        their stability makes them more tolerant of natural
                        conditions like bumpy or weedy ice.
