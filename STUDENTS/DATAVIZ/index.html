        <h1>A Comparison of Shohei Ohtani and Babe Ruth</h1>
        <h2>A Closer Look Into Whether Shohei Ohtani is the Modern Day Babe Ruth</h2>
        <h3>By Franklin Zessis</h3>
        <p>
            Since Shohei Ohtani's MLB emergence in 2018, baseball fans
            have been mesmerized by his dominacne on the mound and at the plate.
            Ohtani's talents have not been seen in baseball since the years of
            Babe Ruth, who retired in 1935. The charts analyze both Ohtani's
            and Ruth's statics from the mound and the plate.
